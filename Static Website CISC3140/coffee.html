      coffee”. It is espresso with a small amount of milk added. A Caffè Macchiato

      of delicious frothy milk.

    <p>A flat white has one or two shots of espresso (just like lattes and flat
      whites) but microfoamed milk is used to create a velvety texture with no foam
      topper – the milk runs right through the coffee.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients: </h2>
<p>
- 1 shot espresso<br/>
- 2 shots foamed milk
</p>
<h2>  Methods:</h2>

  </div>

<div class="about" id="cappuccino">
  <h5>Cappuccino</h5>
  <h2>About: </h2>
    <p>In Italian, cappuccino means "little cap," which perfectly describes the head
       of foamed milk that sits atop the drink's espresso base. According to history,
       it also allegedly derives from the dress of the Capuchin order of monks. With their
       iconic brown hooded cowls and shaved heads, Capuchin monks are a pretty close human
       resemblance to the ring of crema and white foam that tops the classic beverage.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients: </h2>
<p>
- 2 shots<br/>
- 4 ounces milk
</p>
<h2>  Methods:</h2>
<p>
- Pull a double shot of espresso into a cappuccino cup.<br/>

- Top the espresso with foamed milk right after foaming.<br/>
- Serve immediately.
  </p>

<div class="about" id="caffelatte">
  <h5>Caffe Latte </h5>
  <h2>About: </h2>
    <p>Caffe Lattes are espresso drinks made with a fairly large amount of foamed milk.
      They are milkier than cappuccinos. In America, many lattes are prepared as flavored
      lattes. In France, caffè latte is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients: </h2>
<p>
- 1 shot espresso<br/>
- 2 shots foamed milk
